                       Applications often fail to perform flawlessly and thus, end up disappointing the end-user. This is exactly where Performance Engineering comes in. It is a comprehensive process that can be applied during or after the software development cycle, to ensure that the resulting outcome is perfectly in sync with the expectations and meets the performance parameters.
